## Aim

My intention was to create a clean design, focusing more on the content. I used bold colours for the branding of each page. I decided to go with separate pages for each section, instead of a one-pager, as some of my pages are quite long (influences, blog).

### Home

This is the first page that people will see, so I want a very clear navigation structure so they can to where they want. I have thought about adding a nice big image in the background, but haven’t found one yet that works.

### Projects

I used a dark, almost black background, as I wanted a professional vibe. I felt that a strong colour like on the other pages would clash with the projects’ logos.

### Influences

This is my list of articles, talks, and podcasts that I have found very influential. I provide it so that people who are interested in development, design, or making digital products have a handy resource that hopefully they get some value out of!

### About

This has a summary of my history and current work situation. I tried to summarise it to just two paragraphs.

It has links to my online presences, such as LinkedIn, GitHub, CodePen, Behance, because that’s what I want potential employers — or in the case of Coder Factory, students — to click on and read and follow.

## Designs

I used the design tool Figma to create my page designs: https://www.figma.com/file/HYojeascIHBqCCYSjvJQROYs/Burnt-Caramel-2016

I went mobile-first, because I wanted it to design to the most constrained size first, and also it is becoming ever more popular — I want someone on the go to be able to look at my website on their phone without any trouble.

## Building

I tried to go as minimal as possible with HTML & CSS.

### HTML

I built my website in HTML5, using tags such as `<article>` and `<header>` to add more meaning to my structure.

### Meta tags

I add `description` and `author` meta tags to my primary pages: Home, Products, and About. The others I may still add down the road.

### CSS

I wrote my CSS mobile-first. I actually didn’t even have any media queries! I sadly used `!important` in one instance, I’m still not proud of it, and will think up a way so I can avoid it.

### Images & Icons

My images are pretty minimal — just the logos on the Products page. I exported them from Figma at 2x resolution, so they would look good on high resolution screens. I used PNGs because they suit graphics better — if I add any photos I would use JPEG instead. Their file sizes were small, just a few 10s of KB.

The icons on my About page are the logos of the various services I have accounts with. I use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), as they have good catalog of logos. I sized the logos to 200% size, using `font-size: 200%` in CSS.
