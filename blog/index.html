                    Currently, Swift does not support creating frameworks to the same extent as the Objective-C tooling allows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, Apple have not yet shipped a Swift framework that can take full advantage of its new features. In the interim they have added some capabilities back to Objective-C, such as optionals and generics, though in a clunkier form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if Apple were to create a new system that allowed Swift binary frameworks, how drastic a change would it be?
